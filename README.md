# Studbud - Assignment 3 repository

## Design Elements

I felt that in order to aid the user in their goal to study this website had to be simplistic so that it would not draw their focus away from the task at hand.

I divided up the website into 2 pages (which eventually became 3 through iteration). These 2 pages were study and tasks. I often find when I study that having all your due tasks open while trying to focus on one thing can become quite overwhelming and makes me panic. I therefore found it important to have the task list on its own seperate page.

For the taks page I decided to combine the kanban board and the task list into one. This allows the user to set their priorities through the kanban board and have all their tasks in one place instead of 2 seperate lists.

For the study page, I wanted it to be very minimal as well as it is meant to serve as a study aid. I decided to have the timer at the top of the page, as this is the element the user is most likely to constantly use during their study session with two smaller sections underneath with dictionary lookup and music.


## Iterations
I started with a kan ban board which I made in repl before moving over to visual studio code. The kanban board has the task list incorporated within it creating one succinct place for the user to view their tasks.

I set up the grid for the study page of the website with the timer, dictionary and music.

I sorted out the formatting of this page, making the boxes the right width and height and added the music player.

For the music segment I embedded this playlist using the embed function from spotify.

I added a favicon to the page using html

This is an image from my original design where I had the stopwatch and pomodoro timer incorporated into one. This was a descision I made in order to create an efficient and easy cite however when putting it into practive I quickly realised this was not going to be effective. I decided to seperate them and have the pomodor timer on a seperate page.

This shows the completed page with the stopwatch timer, dictionary and music player. It creates an easily accessible user experience so that the user can use this website as a study aid. 

The following 3 screenshots also show the completed web page

I created the pomodoro timer with the same intention of simplicity so that it was just a clean screen for the user to have open while they work.

The iterations that I went through on the design process were more subtle than drastically changing any part of my website design. This included changing minor things such as the buttons to text based buttons which clearly communicate to the user how each section functions. This eliminates the need for extra text which would clutter the otherwise calming space.

A second iteration is the addition of the modal. In my original design I had not really scoped out how the user would add the task however when actually making it, it became clear that a small drop down window would be the best option as it kept the addition of text out of the way. This kept with the minimalistic style.

Overall I went through small iterations however my end product remained rather similar to the inital design. This, once again, was because of the minimilistic approch which I went for in this web app. Creating a studying buddy to aid and not distact a user.
